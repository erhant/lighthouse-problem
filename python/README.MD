# Lighthouse Problem (Python)

I had initially written the Python code for this, but I re-wrote it in Javascript for `canvas-sketch`.

## Usage

You only need Python with `numpy` and `matplotlib`.

In both variations, there are two functions: `draw_all` and `draw_match`. The input is the number of lighthouses. It will plot the lighthouses, it will show the illumination lines and the intersection of x-axis with the dark area defining ray between lighthouse 0. If you only want to see the computation, without losing time with plots, use `compute_darkness` instead. You can also obtain the plots above via `plot_results` function.
